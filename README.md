## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *Making a Website Responsive*, 
wherein we had to design a responsive website in line with a given design specification. 

***

## Technologies
  
I used **HTML5** and **CSS3** to complete this project.  More specifically, I used **CSS Flexbox** and 
**CSS Media Queries** to ensure that the design of this website is fully responsive and performs well on 
devices of differing screen size.

## Setup

Simply download this project, navigate to the 'index.html' file, and double-click thereon.
